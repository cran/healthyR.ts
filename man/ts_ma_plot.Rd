\usage{
ts_ma_plot(
  .data,
  .date_col,
  .value_col,
  .ts_frequency = "monthly",
  .main_title = NULL,
  .secondary_title = NULL,
  .tertiary_title = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{The data you want to visualize. This should be pre-processed and
the aggregation should match the \code{.frequency} argument.}

\item{.date_col}{The data column from the \code{.data} argument.}

\item{.value_col}{The value column from the \code{.data} argument}

\item{.ts_frequency}{The frequency of the aggregation, quoted, ie. "monthly", anything else
will default to weekly, so it is very important that the data passed to this
function be in either a weekly or monthly aggregation.}

\item{.main_title}{The title of the main plot.}

\item{.secondary_title}{The title of the second plot.}

\item{.tertiary_title}{The title of the third plot.}
}
\value{
A few time series data sets and two plots.
}
\description{
This function will produce two plots. Both of these are moving average plots.
One of the plots is from \code{\link[xts:plot.xts]{xts::plot.xts()}} and the other a \code{ggplot2} plot. This
is done so that the user can choose which type is best for them. The plots are
stacked so each graph is on top of the other.
}
\details{
This function expects to take in a data.frame/tibble. It will return
a list object so it is a good idea to save the output to a variable and extract
from there.
